Preliminary Collaboration with Farook Nafey - Migration of a semi monolitique application to a microservice re-architecture

The source application is a tensor flow demo including load balancer that alow the creation of 3 instances cluster (deployed in a Free Cloud in San Jose region)

This is the entry point of an incremental multi-tenancies, multi-cloud, and multi-region cloud applications provisioning scenario that is automated using the following DevOps tools: GitHub, Hashicorp Terraform, Ansible, OCI-CLI and Linux bash shell. 

Behind the scene we also used our own custom tool (Click 2 Consume), build in Oracle CloudShell as well as Oracle Managed Resources (Terraform Managed Service).  

Jenkins is used to glue the whole together as a DevOps CI/CD pipeline.
